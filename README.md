# Gentlemans Gallery
Changes from rezreal original:
1. Cayote device linking made to match https://github.com/rezreal/coyote , which seems to have resolved connecting a device.
2. Images are no longer censored in the browser itself and no boxes are displayed.
3. Button to start gallery was not appearing for me--it now is always shown, but obviously only works when you load images first.

to do:
- Alternate gallery type does not seem to work.
- Would be nice if images all resized to a standard size to prevent needing to zoom in or out ect.
- Find a way to make it properly show when the cayote service loads fully so you don't need to watch the console for that.

npm install
npm run start
