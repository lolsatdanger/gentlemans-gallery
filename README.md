# Gentlemans Gallery
Changes from rezreal original:
1. Cayote device linking made to match https://github.com/rezreal/coyote , which seems to have resolved connecting a device. (It was not working before)
2. Images are no longer censored in the browser itself and no boxes are displayed. (Censoring, personally, defeats the purpose of not looking if you can't look anyway)
3. Button to start gallery was not appearing for me--it now is always shown, but obviously only works when you load images first.

to do:
- Alternate gallery type does not seem to work.
- Would be nice if images all resized to a standard size to prevent needing to zoom in or out ect.
- Find a way to make it properly show when the cayote service loads fully so you don't need to watch the console for that.

npm install
npm run start
